The following project is based on detecting brain stroke. The project includes the following attributes:
1. Exporing the dataset. Identifying unique values and anomaly.
2. Cleaning the dataset.
3. Outlier detection.
4. Creating new features from existing features.
5. Stroke detection by using KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
6. Result analysis.
